# ASU Notes

An unfinished collection of some of the notes I've written during undergrad.
They tend to stop when I ran out of time, finished the semester (after getting
behind on trascribing them), or realized
the notes I was taking (or that method of taking them, at least) wasn't really
helping. If there's interest, I can probably actually finish them up since I
have the written notes still, but for now this is just to make it easier for me
to access my notes when I'm not at my computer and potentially share snippets.
